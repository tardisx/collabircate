CollabIRCate is a free, open-source collaboration tool. It leverages 
existing services and environments, IRC, email, the web, rather than 
trying to force you to learn Yet Another Tool.

You can use it to facilitate communication between members of a project,
as an education tool, or just to keep in touch with your friends.
