...

Result: PASS

All good!

Configuration
-------------

All configuration is within collabircate.conf

Deploy the DB schema
--------------------

Run bin/deploy.pl to deploy the sqlite db schema.

Installing the web component as a CGI
-------------------------------------

TBD

Running the IRC server and bot
------------------------------

The server is bin/irc_server.pl and the bot is bin/irc_bot.pl

Running them is presently probably best done via 'screen' or
similar. In the future they will properly daemonise and have logging
for monitoring.

Run the irc_server.pl first, give it time to come up before starting
the bot.

Trying it out
-------------

Log in with your favourite client. Join the #channel of your choice and
/invite the bot to your channel.
