Testing the system
------------------

[skaro:~/collabircate] justin% script/collabircate_testharness.pl
...
All tests successful.
Files=8, Tests=29,  3 wallclock secs ( 0.04 usr  0.03 sys +  2.30 cusr  0.34 csys =  2.71 CPU)
Result: PASS

All good!

Installing
----------

Put the entire directory in the filesystem at the place of your
choosing.  Note that you probably DO NOT want to run 'make install'.

Installing the web component as a CGI
-------------------------------------

Something like this in an appropriate virtualhost should do the trick:

ScriptAlias /urlprefix "/path/to/CollabIRCate/script/collabircate_cgi.pl"

Where 'urlprefix' is whatever you choose for the CollabIRCate URL's - the 
system is happy to be rooted wherever you like.
