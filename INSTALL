Testing the system
------------------

[skaro:~/collabircate] justin% script/collabircate_testharness.pl
...
All tests successful.
Files=8, Tests=29,  3 wallclock secs ( 0.04 usr  0.03 sys +  2.30 cusr  0.34 csys =  2.71 CPU)
Result: PASS

All good!

Installing
----------

Put the entire directory in the filesystem at the place of your
choosing.  Note that you probably DO NOT want to run 'make install'.

Configuration
-------------

All configuration is within collabircate.conf

Installing the web component as a CGI
-------------------------------------

Something like this in an appropriate virtualhost should do the trick:

Apache:

ScriptAlias /urlprefix "/path/to/CollabIRCate/script/collabircate_cgi.pl"

Lighttpd:

$HTTP["url"] =~ "^/urlprefix" {
  alias.url = ( "/urlprefix" => 
                  "/path/to/CollabIRCate/script/collabircate_cgi.pl" )
  cgi.assign = ( "" => "" )
}

Where 'urlprefix' is whatever you choose for the CollabIRCate URL's - the 
system is happy to be rooted wherever you like.

Deploy the DB schema
--------------------

Run bin/deploy.pl to deploy the sqlite db schema.

Running the IRC server and bot
------------------------------

The server is bin/irc_server.pl and the bot is bin/irc_bot.pl

Running them is presently probably best done via 'screen' or
similar. In the future they will properly daemonise and have logging
for monitoring.

Run the irc_server.pl first, give it time to come up before starting
the bot.

Trying it out
-------------

Log in with your favourite client. Join the #channel of your choice and
/invite the bot to your channel.
