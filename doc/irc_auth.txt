When users are first noticed by the bot, we track them. We can believe
that a user, as represented by a single IRC username/hostname
combination is the same person. The nick is arbitrary and can be changed
at will.

The username and hostname is also relatively arbitrary, but we only use
it for tracking, not for identifying.

Before we identify a user, we track them based on the aforementioned
criteria. Any logs they emit we still want to track, but we want to mark
these logs as 'untrustworthy'. This status can be changed if the user is
subsequently identified.

When such a user is first noticed, the bot challenges them. The
challenge is a request to authenticate, either via a unique web link,
or via a pre-shared password.

The former will cause them to login or create an account, and their
previous logs for that IRC login, and any subsequent logs will be
marked with the correct username.

The latter will allow them to authenticate entirely through IRC, in a
similar way as you would to a nickserv. The pre-shared secret would be
setup in the web interface.
