When users are first noticed by the bot, we need to identify them. We
want messages from them to be identified with a single UID inside the
CollabIRCate system.

We can possibly do this with some sort of automated method (IP
address, private token share).

Failing that, we need to tell the user that we don't know who they
are, and that there messages may not be permanently logged until we
do. We do this by sending them a private message with a token, as part
of a URL.

When the user visits this URL, they login with their known username
and password, or they create an account.

At this point the system tells the bot the mapping between the IRC
user and the CollabIRCate user, and the log records are marked
correctly.
