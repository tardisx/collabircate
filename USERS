Dealing with users

Users on IRC are unauthenticated. We could force them to authenticate
(via IRC server auth mechanisms), but this is undesirable:

* it would mean only using our IRC server, never an existing one
* IRC doesn't 'work that way' and it would prove a hurdle for users
  to overcome

So we need to provide an alternative. The first goal here is to not
get in people's way. Initially we want people to log on and take part
without having to go to the trouble of obtaining a
username/password. In addition, some server admins may want the system
to work this way always. In this case, the system is simply 'open' and
users never authenticate.

We should not throw away their entries because they are
unauthenticated. We should keep them, and let them be 'tagged' with
the correct username once we have identified them.

An IRC user is represented as nick!username@host.name. The username part
of easily changed by the user, and of course the nick can be changed
at any time.  The username@host.name section identifies a user at that
particular point in time. This is an IRC user instance.

All IRC logs are identified with a link to the IRC user instance. This
is the only link, and never goes away.

At any time we should allow a user to authenticate and this would
immediately tag any previous records with the correct username. This
would link the IRC user instance with the correct username. Thus:

  log record => irc user instance

becomes (when linked):

  log record => irc user instance => real user

Authentication (linking of an irc user instance with a real user)
should be as easy as possible:

* via a private message to the bot auth TOKEN USERNAME PASSWORD (security issue?)
* via a web page link (with hash to identify this nick!user@host.name)
* via email (for users who can't easily switch to a browser)

These all require some sort of token (though perhaps the first private message does
not). In each case:

Web:

* foonick tells the bot "I want to be identified" 
* the bot gives the foonick a token which has a unique id, associated with
  the irc user instance
* the user clicks a link like "/link/abcdef12345"
* the user logs in as foo with the correct password
* the system links that irc user instance with the real user

Email:

* foonick tells the bot "I want to be identified, I am foo, email me"
* the bot emails foo's registered email address
* the email provides the web link, or a token mailback option
* the system links that irc user instance with the real user
