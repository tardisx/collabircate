Dealing with users

Users on IRC are unauthenticated. We could force them to authenticate (via IRC
server auth mechanisms), but this is undesirable:

* it would mean only using our IRC server, never an existing one
* IRC doesn't 'work that way' and it would prove a hurdle for users
  to overcome

So we need to provide an alternative. The first goal here is to not get in
people's way. Initially we want people to log on and take part without having
to go to the trouble of obtaining a username/password. In addition, some server
admins may want the system to work this way always. In this case, the system is
simply 'open' and users never authenticate.

We should not throw away their entries because they are unauthenticated. We
should keep them, and let them be 'tagged' with the correct username once we
have identified them.

An IRC user is represented as nick!user@host.name. The username part of
easily changed by the user, and of course the nick can be changed at any time.
The user@host.name section identifies a user at that particular point in time.

At any time we should allow a user to authenticate and this would immediately
tag any previous records with the correct username. To be reasonable this would
perhaps only go back a certain amount of time (configurable).

Since the only (semi) trustworthy part of the signature is the hostname, in the
day of shared hosts and proxy servers, it may be required by some admins that
all log messages from non authenticated users are discarded and retro-active
tagging is simply not possible.

Authentication should be as easy as possible:

* via a private message to the bot auth USERNAME PASSWORD
* via a web page link (with hash to identify this nick!user@host.name)
